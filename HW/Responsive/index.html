      <h3> The Creed of Zeta Tau Alpha but Sirley Kreasan Strout</h3>
      <h5>
        To realized within our grasp in Zeta Tau Alpha lies the opportunity to learn those things that will ever enrich and enoble our lives. To be true to ourselves and those within and without our circle. To think in terms of all mankind and our service to the world; to be steadfast, strong, and clean or heart and mind remembering that since the thought is father to the deed only that which we would have manifested in our experience should be entertained in thought. To find satisfaction in being rather than seeming thus strengthening in us the higher qualities of the spirit. To prepare for service and learn the nobility of serving thereby earning the right to be served.To seek understanding that we might gain true wisdom. To look for the good in everone. To see beauty with its enriching influence. To be humble in success without biterness in defeat striving ever to make our lives a symphony of high ideals. Devotion to the Right the Good and the True without a discordinate note, remembering always that the foundational precept of Zeta Tau Alpha was love, the greatest of all things.
