My name is Emily Gossett and I am a sophomore at the University of Miami, majoring in Communicaion Studies and Sociology.I am from London, England but my parents are American. I grew up going to an international school with people from all over the world and with teachers who were both American and international. I grew up exposed to so many cultures that I really enjoy traveling and learning about new cutures.
